# Graphs
- The graph can add ,add edges between the vertex and can remove vertex as well. 

## Challenge
- connecting the vertices and counting the edge was challenging. 

## Approach & Efficiency
- I tried to implement the concept of linkedList. 

## API
- AddNode - It inserts value to the graph.
- AddEdge - It connect between to vertex or node of graph.
- GetNodes - It lists all the node values.
- GetNeighbors - It lists all the connected nodes.
- Size - It tells how large the node is.
